  abstract     = {Nearly all networked devices use the Internet Protocol (IP) for their communications. IP version 6 (IPv6) is the current version of IP and provides advantages over the legacy IP version 4 (IPv4). Most notably, the IPv4 address space is inadequate to support the increasing number of networked devices requiring routable IP addresses, whereas IPv6 provides a vast address space to meet current and future needs. While some technologies, such as network infrastructure, are more affected by IPv6 than others, nearly all networked hardware and software are affected in some way as well. As a result, IPv6 has broad impact on cybersecurity that organizations should address with due diligence. IPv6 security issues are quite similar to those from IPv4. That is, the security methods used with IPv4 should typically be applied to IPv6 with adaptations as required to address the differences with IPv6. Security issues associated with an IPv6 implementation will generally surface in networks that are new to IPv6, or in early phases of the IPv6 transition. These networks lack maturity in IPv6 configurations and network security tools. More importantly, they lack overall experience by the administrators in the IPv6 protocol. Dual stacked networks (that run both IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously) have additional security concerns, so further countermeasures are needed to mitigate these risks due to the increased attack surface of having both IPv4 and IPv6.},
